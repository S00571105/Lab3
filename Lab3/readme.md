## Executive Summary 
Lab three defined software types, roles of applications, utility, operating systems and  ERP practices working with virtualization, role of hypervisor  and Python. In addition this section also explored career resources of handshake and bureau of labor statistics and opportunities in information technology as well as co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry associations and student organization membership. 

## Software
Is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

### Types of Software
Types of software can be application, utility or operating systems. The roles of application, utility and operating system software will be explained next with an example of each. The roles of applications are to perform specific tasks such as word processing, data base management, video games or browsing the web. A specific example of an application well known to all us is word in the Micro Office suite of products. Utility software is designed to help analyze, configure, optimize or maintain a computer; an example of utility software is antivirus software.  Operating system software is the first loaded into the computer by the boot program it basically manages all of the programs in the computer. It manages hardware resources, user interfaces, and provides a platform for software developers to write applications. An example of operating system software for personal computers is Microsoft Windows.

### ERP
An explanation of the ERP software is basically a type of software that organizations use to manage day to day business activities such as accounting, procurement, project management, risk management, compliance and supply chain operations. Specific examples of ERP systems include SAP, Oracle and Microsoft.

## Virtualization
Virtualization is basically technology that allows you to create useful IT services for using resources that are traditionally bound to hardware. 

### Problems Solved by Virtualization
 IT problems solved by virtualization are that servers may be split to do independent tasks to allow for more efficient use of hardware

### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisors support the creation and management of virtual machines by abstracting a computer’s software from the hardware. So, the role of hypervisor in virtualization is hypervisors make virtualization possible by translating requests between the physical and virtual resources.

## Python
Python is an interpreed high-level general purpose programming language. It design emphasized code readablility. It assists programmers to write clear, logical code for small and big projects.

### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
The pseudo code nature of Python is one of its greatest assets; it allows you to focus on the solution to the problem rather than the language itself.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
The difference between interpreted vs compiled language is in the result of the process of interpreting or compiling. The interpreter produces a result from a program, whereby a compiler produces a program written in assembly language

## Career Exploration
Career exploration resources are available by Tri- C handshake, BLS, certifications, degrees, co-ops, internships and industry associations.

### Handshake
Handshake is a great resource provided by Tri-C on jobs available to Tri-C students. My experience/finding with handshake it will be a great resource for the future when seeking a job in information technology.

### Bureau of Labor Statistics
Bureau of Labor Statistics is government resource that provides a wealth of information on labor statistics and demands for occupations like information technology. My findings are the information technology is in high demand and has a great future per the bureau of labor statistics.

### Certifications
My findings after reviewing the certifications of CompTIA, Cisco and CISSP is I found those all interesting certifications to possible ascertain in the future.  In addition it was great to learn some vouchers are available from the IT Dean’s office.

### Certificates and Degrees
All the certificates and degrees are offered by Tri-C I found very interesting and appealing. However the Cybersecurity and Programming and Development post degree certificates are of short term and post degree of interest to me.

### Co-ops / Internships
The process to becoming co-op “ready” and benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship are explained below. Co-op ready is basically a process of becoming ready for a co-op by doing self -skill- assessments to gain understanding of employability skills, identifying employability skills you can develop to get ready for co-op and learn about on-campus and off-campus opportunities to develop skills. And the benefits of a co-op and internship provide valuable opportunities to put their education and skills to use in a work environment to assist in making contributions to the work world and preparing the student for a future job. Both a co-op and intern provide a marketable value to the student for future employers.

### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
There are many industry associations and student organizations that offer great value to students to get involved in organizations to become better acquainted to the student’s field of interest. The one organization that I found very interesting is the IEEE. I feel this membership in this organization would be very valuable to me due to the fact the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is dedicated to advancing innovation and technology excellent to benefit of humanity. It is the world’s largest technical professional organization. Members included computer professionals, software developers, information technologists and many more professionals. IEEE’s basic purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. And by joining this organization I would benefit by being part of a great organization and meeting members from many professions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion lab three was very informative and covered defined software types, roles of applications, utility, operating systems and ERP practices working with virtualization, role of hypervisor and Python. In addition lab three also explored career resources of handshake and bureau of labor statistics and opportunities in information technology as well as co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry associations and student organization membership.
